<h1>Apple</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An apple invokes the spirit of a hot summer's dayâ€“of days past and futures yet to be seen. When I was young, my mother told me "an apple a day keeps the doctor away". Later that day she died of the common cold. I write this now, consuming my daily apple, and wish that she would have taken her own advice.</p>
